Ducci sequence &#x1f50d; &#x1f3e0; Wikipedia &#x1F3B2; Ducci sequence A Ducci sequence is a sequence of n-tuples of integers, sometimes known as "the Diffy game", because it is based on sequences. Given an n-tuple of integers ( a 1 , a 2 , . . . , a n ) {\displaystyle (a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n})} , the next n-tuple in the sequence is formed by taking the absolute differences of neighbouring integers: ( a 1 , a 2 , . . . , a n ) â ( | a 1 â a 2 | , | a 2 â a 3 | , . . . , | a n â a 1 | ) . {\displaystyle (a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n})ightarrow (|a_{1}-a_{2}|,|a_{2}-a_{3}|,...,|a_{n}-a_{1}|)\,.} Another way of describing this is as follows. Arrange n integers in a circle and make a new circle by taking the difference between neighbours, ignoring any minus signs; then repeat the operation. Ducci sequences are named after Enrico Ducci (1864 - 1940), the Italian mathematician who discovered in the 1930s that every such sequence eventually becomes periodic. Ducci sequences are also known as the Ducci map or the n-number game. Open problems in the study of these maps still remain. This article is issued from Wikipedia.
