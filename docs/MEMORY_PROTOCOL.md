# Memory Protocol

This project maintains persistent memory across all development:

1. No feature or plan is ever "forgotten"
2. All experiments (successful or not) are documented
3. Future LLM interactions must preserve all context
4. The README is the canonical source of truth

## Current Memory Items
- Daily Brain Boost: Fully operational
- Voice Assistant: Components tested, integration pending
- Local LLMs: Models downloaded, wrappers created
- Calendar: Sync working, voice control planned
- Knowledge Base: Kiwix server configured
- Budget Agent: Designed, not implemented
